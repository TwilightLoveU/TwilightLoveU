## Hi there 👋
### Welcome to my world!

#### For the lazy INFP/INTP young man here:
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  1. Programming: `C`, `Java`
  2. Music: Composing ( `J-Pop`, `Vocaloid`, ... )
- 📫 How to reach me: Guess what? I've already upload my e-mail
- 😄 Pronouns: Be at home (No offensive words is OK)
- ⚡ Fun fact:
  1. I love rhythm games like:
     <br>❤`project sekai colorful stage: feat. Hatsune miku ( pjsk )`
     <br>❤`Arcaea ( current ptt: 11.85 )`
  3. I love proggramming!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with:
  <br>Development: `VS Code ( for C environment )`
  <br>Adobe creating: `PS Pr Ae Au`
  <br>modeling: `Blender`
  <br>`UE4/UE5`

  
  Some tools/IDE are not so eazy for a fresh to use... in any fields
